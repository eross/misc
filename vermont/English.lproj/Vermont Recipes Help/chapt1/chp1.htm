It is written in the Objective-C programming language using Apple Computer's Cocoa frameworks for Mac OS X.</font></p>		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande, Helvetica, Arial">Vermont Recipes demonstrates how a variety of user controls and other features work in a typical Mac OS X application. You may freely distribute it so long as you don't alter it in any way.</font></p>		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande, Helvetica, Arial">If you would like to learn how to write a Cocoa application of your own with any of the features you see here, buy the book! The first five recipes are available online at the Stepwise Web site, www.stepwise.com. You can also download all of the application's project files, including full source code, from the Stepwise Web site.</font></p>		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande, Helvetica, Arial">Vermont Recipes will run under Mac OS X 10.1, but some of its features require Mac OS X 10.2 (Jaguar), released by Apple Computer on August 24, 2002. For example, you can't save or open documents under Mac OS X 10.1 because the application uses keyed archiving, a new Cocoa technology introduced in Mac OS X 10.2. The book includes information about how to program many new Cocoa technologies like keyed archiving.</font></p>		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande, Helvetica, Arial">The focus of the book is a multidocument, multiwindow application built using the Cocoa AppKit and Foundation frameworks.</font></p>	</body></html>
