It simply demonstrates how a variety of user controls and other application features work in a typical Mac OS X application</font><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande, Helvetica, Arial">.</font>		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande, Helvetica, Arial">The book on which the application is based, <i><b>Cocoa Recipes for Mac OS X&#151;The Vermont Recipes</b></i>, Peachpit Press, www.peachpit.com, explains how to create all of these controls and features using the Objective-C programming language and Apple's Cocoa frameworks. To learn how to buy the book, choose Help &gt; Read Me or Vermont Recipes &gt; About Vermont Recipes.</font></p>		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande, Helvetica, Arial">When you launch Vermont Recipes or click its icon in the Dock while no document window is open, an untitled document window opens. Choose File &gt; New to open additional untitled document windows. After saving and closing a document, reopen it by choosing File &gt; Open or File &gt; Open Recent or double-click the document's icon in the Finder.</font></p>		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande, Helvetica, Arial">Each Vermont Recipes document has a main window containing a tab view with three panes. Each pane contains a group of user controls of a similar kind: buttons, sliders, and text fields. Click a tab to go to that pane, or click the Back and Next buttons to cycle through all of them.</p>		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande, Helvetica, Arial">A document's main window also has a drawer containing a scrolling text view where you can type or paste notes. Click the Notes button in the main document window to open and close the drawer. To resize the drawer and the notes view horizontally, drag the drawer's outer edge left or right, and you can close the drawer by dragging its edge almost all the way back to the window. The notes view supports all standard Mac OS X editing features, including multiple undo and redo, drag-and-drop editing, and formatting using the commands in the Format menu.</p>		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande, Helvetica, Arial">The Open in Window button at the bottom of the drawer opens a second, ancillary document window. This window contains a split view allowing you to read and edit different parts of the notes from the drawer's notes view. The notes window can be resized and moved anywhere on the desktop.</p>		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande, Helvetica, Arial">Two kinds of help are available explaining how to use individual features of the application:</p>		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande, Helvetica, Arial">1. <b>Help tags</b>. Move the mouse over any user control in the application and pause there. You don't have to click. After a moment, a small Help tag appears briefly explaining what the control is or what it does. After a few more moments, the Help tag fades away.</p>		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande, Helvetica, Arial">2. <b>Context help</b>. Press the Help key on your keyboard or, if you're using a PowerBook or a keyboard without a Help key, choose Help &gt; Turn Context Help On. The cursor turns into a large question mark. Click any user control. A large Help tag appears giving more detailed information about the control and its use. Click anywhere to dismiss the tag.</p>	</body></html>
