Created Wednesday 29 July 2009

++ Board Id

- go to the hw/src/board_ifc/src/ifc directory and add an appropriate new number to the particular product family.  If this is a BPD product, then add it to board_fam_hpbpd.h

- Edit the ampere.mf makefile and redefine BOARD_RANGE so that the first four hex digits correspond to BPD/Ampere codes

- in the hw/src/board_ampere/src/ifc/board_id_cfg.h file you'll need to remove the BENZ entries and add an entry to remap the HPVPP/VOLTA board_id to HPBPD/AMPERE so that we can reflash Ampere code onto Volta boards.

- Scan the firmware for the C identifier "VOLTA" and add any references for FORBOARD(HPBPD,AMPERE) to get the firmware to compile

nca.c:

nvm_tbl_reg_t _nvm_btl_reg =  (change versions)

Unconditional reset of nvm part.  ds2_sys.c: _start() -- look for reset_bits.
