Created Wednesday 29 July 2009

++ BB1Features

Key dates:
    PI1 dry pens:  5/11
    PI1 wet pens:  5/20
    Litho Volta plumbed for ink by 5/15
    Production Volta: 5/26
    Ampere BB1 6/9
    Ampere BB1 paper/carriage motion 6/16
    Ampere BB1 Tier 0:  6/23
    BB2 parts release: 8/1 +/-
Key constraints:
    4 weeks of test on BB1 before BB2 parts release.
    1 week from delivery of BB1 unit to basic media path features (see below)
    2 weeks from delivery to tier 0 functionality.
    
Assumptions:
    Litho Volta print/service station capable by 5/20.
    Litho Ampere (no service station) print capable by 6/2

Issues:
    Jam recovery is not defined.  (contacting Alex Nameroff for more info)
    
Tier 0 features:
    Basic Media path:  load, deskew, eject, power cycle jam recovery, duplexing, DPU, carriage motion
    Service station: all motion primitives
    Service algorithms:  primitives:  wipes, spits, scrapes, etc.
                         No auto priming -- this will be done via scripts.
                         DPU, uncap, cap, midjob servicing--miniumum needed to keep pens healthy.                         
    Benz front panel(led, buttons).  Benz functionality (no wifi)
    Pen control(no auto calibration).   Thermal control,spit,print
    Datapath -- ME test suite.  Minimum on 6/23 "bars" and "new territories".  Others to follow ASAP. 
    Connectivity:  USB only/flextool compatible. 
    
Issue:  Jam recovery is not defined.  For now assuming power cycle jam recovery
