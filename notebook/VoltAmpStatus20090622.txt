Issues?
1) Waiting for for test files--still!
2) i2c assert?  Not seen on RAM build.  Need a working/printing unit to duplicate this.  Will wait until we get print heads.
3) Width limitations on Volta.  Need to put a note up on Wiki to tell people we will force printing on ramps.(Dan Mag)
4) Assert on glossy printing(this should be working).
5) Pen failures:  need DS object for interrogating last failure to send to Toby.  Toby will check: a) serial output for failure b) turn failures into asserts? c) DS object for post-failure analysis.
6) OK button does not seem to "continue".(Volta)  Dan Mag will try to duplicate on his unit. (suspect there might be a bad panel).


Current tasks?
Christine:  Taipan P0 mech to work on Shaid.  Should work on Volta/Ampere.  1-2 weeks.  ILG based on shaid.  Defaulted to off. Look in hw-- shaid for commands.

Tim: helping out/issue killing.  Off on Pentane/PDL anal.

Marc: figuring out how to use max clock freq and minimum firing freq.  39Mhz clock(overclocking).  Might need to go down to 38-39.  Still discovering all the variables.  Not sure on visible error if pushed to high.

Liz: Ampere functionality.  Speed mech(head/tail) docs.  Getting synched up with latest ME needs.  Waiting for test files.

Toby: Eliminated unique ID bits.  Using startup prime bit.  Same as Python infrastructure.
 
Dan Magnusson: Priming in place for Ampere(script).  Trying to use same script for V and A. (Brouwer-based). Page-width assert.  Can comment out the asserts.    


This weeks releases?
Print zone.
Priming via scripts (Ampere.  Already in Volta).


Who is here next week?
Liz (Tue-Wed),  Dan Mag(Mon,Tue), Marc, Bruce(on call). Tim, Eric GONE!

Demo.
Demoing BB1.  Who is doing it?  What are we demoing? Speed mech file?  Eric will check with Dan McD on what we need to do.


Notes:
  Won't need to reprime with supply change--heard by Dan Mag from Ian.
  IMF FW sharepoint:

   Printmodes?  All should be in there.
