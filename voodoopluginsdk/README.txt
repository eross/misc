Ok, the first thing that you should note about this plugin api, is that it's unofficial.  I'm probably going to be changing it in a future release.  This release it to get plugins started, and to get feedback from developers of plugins.

The API for the plugin is documented in VPPlugin.h

Things have changed a little bit since I started working on the plugin api for VP (but you never saw it..), so if you are wondering why the classes are flung all over the place, that's why.  I imagine there will be some consolidation before 2.0 is final.

If you have questions, ideas, or enhancement requests email gus@flyingmeat.com with them.

thanks,
